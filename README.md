#React Pomodoro Timer

___

This [pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a project for the Free Code Camp curriculum. It's built with React and styled in Sass with the help of Bourbon and Neat.

The code 'should' include helpful comments. I'll add more information regarding the webpack setup once I've done it.
