#React Pomodoro Timer

___

This [pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a project for the Free Code Camp curriculum. It's built with React and styled in Sass with the help of Bourbon and Neat.

I have included some (hopefully) helpful comments in the files.

##How to Use
Clone or download this repo. Run `npm install` from the root folder. Once all the dependencies have been installed, run `npm start` and open your favourite browser to http://localhost:8080.

##TODO
- Handle maximum (60) and minimum (1) values for the break and session inputs. A check must be added to the onChange functions.
- Add a helpful notification if input value is not allowed.
